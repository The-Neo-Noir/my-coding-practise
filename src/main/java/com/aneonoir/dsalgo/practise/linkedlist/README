List: Notes and Tips and Tricks and Questions
    Java list interface , ordered collection
    ArrayList,LinkedList , Vector
    AbstractList
abstract data type , not a concrete data structure, these are interfaces in java, specifying
the specs on what that type of data  exhibits behavior

ArrayLists:
    > underlying/backing data structure is array.
    > If you are retrieving more than writing then this is a choice to go
    > If you know the capacity in advanced then please do using the ArrayList() capacity.
    > capacity vs size: capacity means what is the initial size of the array after its filled it has to expand
    where as size is only what is added to the arraylist.
     the default initial capacity is 10.
    >It implements  List and RandomAccess interface which is a marker interface.
    > you can update an element by using set(index,object);
    > size : o(1)
    > add() : o(1);
    > add(index,object) : o(n) , it shifts the elements.if it has on its right
    > get(i) : o(1)
    > toArray() return  object[]
    > toArray(T[]); return the type specified
    >contains() method expects the object to override equals method, but not hashcode, but
    its a good practise to override the hashcode , lest we use the object in hash based collections
       contains() ; o(n)
    > indexOf(index) : o(n)

    






implement a singly linked list class



warm up questions: Warm up questions are generally datastructure questions to get
your basic understanding tested.

> Implement a singly linked list
   > add,
   add(index,object)
   remove,
   remove(index)
   size
   isEmpty
