All possible sorting algorithms:
    1. Bubble sort
    2. Selection sort
    3. Insertion Sort
    4. Shell Sort
    5. Radix sort
    6. Quick Sort
          Select the pivot on left most , right most or the median
        > Dual pivot quick sort
        > 3 way quick sort
        > Quick sort on singly linked list
        > quick sort on double linked list

    7. Merge Sort
    8. Counting Sort
    9. Radix Sort
    10.Heap sort
            > If you need the largest Item then min heap , if you need smallest item then max heap
    11.Bucket Sort

Questions
> Warm up:
    Bubble Sort:
    =================
    Notes:
        Comparision based sorting.
        Is Stable sort: Yes
        Best case time complexity: o(n) or o(n*n) depending on implementation
        Worst case time complexity : o(n*n)
        In place: yes


    > implement bubble sort: see BubbleSort.java
    > implement bubble sort with best case as o(n) , see BubbleSortWithOnApproach.java
